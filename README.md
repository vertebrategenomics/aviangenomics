# aviangenomics

**Overview**

This repository contains data and scripts related to the genome assembly, annotation, and analysis of finch species (family Fringillidae). The project aims to study genome structure, evolutionary history, and immune gene functions across different bird genomes.

**Contents**

    HoFi_hifiasm_assembly: Contains genome assembly files for Haemorhous mexicanus (House Finch) produced using HiFi sequencing data and assembled with the Hifiasm algorithm.
    HoFi_RNA-spades_assemblies: Contains transcriptome assembly files for Haemorhous mexicanus (House Finch) produced using Illumina RNA-seq reads with the RNA-SPAdes tool.
    Scripts: Contains scripts used for quality assessment, data processing, and analysis.


**Data**

Due to storage limitations, raw .fasta, .fastq, .fna, .fa, and .sra files are not stored here. The accesion numbers for the raw reads used can be found in the automation scripts. (I will add my code once I complete my master's project).

**Dependencies**

The following tools are required to run analyses in this project:

    FastQC
    BUSCO
    QUAST
    SPAdes
    Hifiasm
    Python 3.8+ and required libraries
