# aviangenomics

**Overview**

This repository contains data and scripts related to the genome assembly, annotation, and analysis of finch species (family Fringillidae). The project aims to study genome structure, evolutionary patterns, and immune gene functions across different bird genomes.

**Contents**

    HoFi_hifiasm_assembly: Contains genome assembly files for Haemorhous mexicanus (House Finch) produced using HiFi sequencing data and assembled with the Hifiasm algorithm.
    Scripts: Contains scripts used for quality assessment, data processing, and analysis.


**Data**

Due to storage limitations, raw .fasta, .fastq, .fna, .fa, and .sra files are not stored here. The accesion numbers for the raw reads used can be found in the automation scripts.

**Dependencies**

The following tools are required to run analyses in this project:

    BUSCO
    QUAST
    Hifiasm
    Python 3.8+ and required libraries
